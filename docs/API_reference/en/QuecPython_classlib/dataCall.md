# dataCall - Establish a Cellular Network Channel

Establishing a cellular network channel refers to the activation of PDP context, and after a successful activation, the PDN gateway of the core network will assign an IP address to the QuecPython module.

The `dataCall` module contains features of configuring, obtaining , activating and deactivating PDP context, and feature of obtaining the module's IP information. After burning the QuecPython firmware into the module, it will automatically establish a cellular network channel upon startup. If you have configured the APN, the module will use the configured APN information for establishment; otherwise, it will use the default APN.



> When using a SIM card from a different operator, you should configure the APN information of the corresponding operator. Failure to configure or incorrect configuration may result in the module's failure to register to the network, failure to establish the network channel, inability to obtain an IP address, and failure to access the Internet. For information on configuring the APN, refer to the `dataCall.setPDPContext` method.



**Example:**

```python
import dataCall
from misc import Power

# The APN information that the user needs to configure. Modify it according to the actual situation
usrConfig = {'apn': '3gnet', 'username': '', 'password': ''}

# Obtains the information of the first APN, confirming whether the currently used APN is the one specified by the user
pdpCtx = dataCall.getPDPContext(1)
if pdpCtx != -1:
    if pdpCtx[1] != pdpConfig['apn']:
        # If it is not the APN that the user needs, configure it as follows
        ret = dataCall.setPDPContext(1, 0, pdpConfig['apn'], pdpConfig['username'], pdpConfig['password'], 0)
        if ret == 0:
            print('APN configuration succeeded.')
            # After restarting, establish the channel according to the configured information
            Power.powerRestart()  
        else:
            print('APN configuration failed.')
    else:
        print('APN has already been configured.')
else:
    print('Failed to obtain PDP Context.')
```



## APN Configuration and Retrieval

### `dataCall.setPDPContext`

```
dataCall.setPDPContext(profileID, ipType, apn, username, password, authType)

```



## Automatic Reconnection

### `dataCall.setAutoConnect`

```python
dataCall.setAutoConnect(profileID, enable)
```

Enables or disables the automatic reconnection feature for the specified `profileID`. Automatic reconnection feature refers to the behavior of the module to automatically reconnect when the module disconnects from the network due to abnormal network conditions, poor signal, or other exceptional scenarios, and the network conditions return to normal.

**Parameter：**

```



## DNS Configuration

### `dataCall.setDNSServer`

```python
dataCall.setDNSServer(profileID, simID, priDNS, secDNS)
```

After establishing the cellular network channel successfully, the module will automatically obtain the DNS server address, and generally it is unnecessary to reconfigure it. If the DNS server address automatically obtained by the module is unavailable, you can reconfigure it with this method.

**Parameter：**

- `profileID` - Integer value. PDP context ID. Range: 1–3.

- `simID` - Integer type. SIM card slot number. `0` indicates SIM0; `1` indicates SIM1. Currently only `0` is supported.

**Parameter：**

* `fun` - The name of the callback function. The format and parameters of the callback function is described as follows:

```python
def netCallback(args):
